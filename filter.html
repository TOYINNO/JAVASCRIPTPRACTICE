    console.log(testArray.fill(10))  

    // the first goes for filling the entire list while the second targets what position to start filling from counting from zero. For our example, 2 rep that count from zero until the second number from the start; then fill the rest (starting from the third position). adding 5 (optional) means the position for ending the filling

let user = ["Elo", "Blessing", "Chidera", "Juliet", "Elohor", "Sammy", "Esther"]

console.log(user.slice(3, 6)) //this means slice out (cut) elements. begin at 3 and end at 6(counting from zero remember)

//let's try splice now. for splice

user.splice(1, 3, "Precious"); // this means to remove any element from a list provided you give it a count e.g in our example; we are saying start from index 1 and cut three out then replace with 'Precious' (you can add as many) and the others remain thesame.
